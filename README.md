# pi-simple-switch
A Simple Raspberry PI GPIO Input from a momentary switch to drive an LED via a GPIO Output

Read the status of a momentary switch on GPIO Pin 16 (note the use of a Blue LED in place of a 10k Ohm Pull down resistor)

On detection of the trailing edge (as the switch is released) change the state of a variable and various LED's tied to GPIO PINs

Change the state of a GPIO Output pin that drives a Buzzer via direct from a GPIO pin to Ground.
